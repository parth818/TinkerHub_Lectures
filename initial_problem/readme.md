## Problem Statement 

Write a dart class for tech learners and mentors. Should have following methods

addStacks() : Add a particular stack of interest/expertise
setMentorOrLearner() : Set whether the participant is learner or mentor
setAvailableTime() : if person is mentor set available time
getMentor() : Takes stack and time as params and finds available mentors. 

*Please use the same method names.

Since the problem statement was so open ended, it wasn't mentioned clearly what actually students have to do. Therefore the code stated here for class declaration including its member functions in Dart programming language is best to my knowledge. Some assumptions have been made like while declaring the member funtion 'getMentor()' no parameters have been passed since it acts on the members of the same class to which it belongs, hence their is no need to pass the parameters, even when its stated explicitly.

void main() function has been added with an empty body to the end of the program to ensure no errors while compilation. The body of this function can be written and edited accordingly to effectively use the above declared class and its member functions.
